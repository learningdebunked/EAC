## 🎯 Overview

The Equity-Aware Checkout (EAC) system learns need states from consented, non-PII behavioral features and public-level SDOH indices, then applies constrained policies at checkout:

- **SNAP/WIC-compatible substitutions**
- **Low-glycemic alternatives**
- **Plan-aware OTC coverage**
- **Delivery windows aligned to mobility limits**
- **Safety-first product nudges**

We formalize fairness and safety objectives alongside business metrics and deploy a **guardrailed contextual bandit** for real-time decisions under **≤100ms latency**.

**Validation Approach:** Since real production deployment is not feasible, we validate the hypothesis through **high-fidelity simulations** using real-world datasets (Instacart, dunnhumby, UCI Retail, RetailRocket) enriched with SDOH data. This enables rigorous counterfactual analysis, reproducibility, and ethical testing without risk to real users.

2. **Zero-Touch Signals**: Personalization without extra user input; opt-in, revocable, explainable
3. **Multi-Objective Optimizer**: Minimizes cost/risk while protecting revenue/latency SLAs
4. **New Equity Metrics**: Equalized Uplift, Price Burden Ratio, Safety Harm Rate
5. **Simulation-Based Validation**: Counterfactual analysis with 100K synthetic users, 1000 replications
6. **Formal Theoretical Guarantees**: Differential privacy (ε ≤ 0.1), convergence proofs, PAC-learning
7. **Reproducible Research**: Full simulation code, synthetic datasets, Docker containers

### Why "Agentic"?

The system exhibits key **agent properties**:

1. **Autonomy**: Makes decisions without human intervention in real-time (≤100ms)
2. **Reactivity**: Responds immediately to checkout events and context changes
3. **Proactivity**: Anticipates needs from SDOH signals before problems arise
4. **Social Ability**: Interacts with users through explainable recommendations
5. **Learning**: Continuously improves from user feedback (online learning)

### Agent Decision Cycle

```python
class EACAgent:
    """AI Agent for Equity-Aware Checkout"""
    
    def process_checkout(self, checkout_event):
        # 1. OBSERVE: Perceive environment
        context = self.perception.observe(checkout_event)
        # → cart, SDOH signals, payment methods, constraints
        
        # 2. THINK: Reason about needs and select policy
        need_states = self.reasoning.infer_needs(context)
        # → food_insecurity: 0.85, financial_constraint: 0.92
        
        policy = self.reasoning.select_policy(context, need_states)
        # → 'snap_wic_substitution' (selected by contextual bandit)
        
        # Check guardrails
        if not self.reasoning.check_guardrails(policy, context):
            return self.safe_default()
        
        # 3. ACT: Execute policy and generate recommendations
        recommendations = self.action.execute_policy(policy, context)
        # → [substitute chips, substitute soda, ...]
        
        # 4. LEARN: Update from user response
        user_response = self.wait_for_user_response(recommendations)
        reward = self.compute_reward(user_response, context)
        self.learning.update(context, policy, reward)
        
        return recommendations
```

### Multi-Objective Optimization

The agent balances competing objectives:

- **User Satisfaction**: Maximize acceptance rate
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimize out-of-pocket spend
- **Health Improvement**: Maximize nutritional quality
- **Fairness**: Ensure equalized uplift across groups
- **Business Viability**: Maintain retailer margins

### Example Scenario

**User**: Low-income household with SNAP/EBT  
**Cart**: Sugary cereal ($4), white bread ($3), soda ($2), chips ($4) = $13 total

**Agent Actions**:
1. **Observes**: SNAP payment + high food insecurity (SDOH)
2. **Thinks**: Food insecurity HIGH (0.92), Nutrition risk HIGH (0.78)
3. **Selects**: SNAP/WIC substitution policy (UCB = 0.88)
4. **Acts**: 
   - Sugary cereal → Whole grain cereal (SNAP, -$0.50, +8 HEI)
   - White bread → Whole wheat bread (SNAP, $0, +5 HEI)
   - Soda → 100% juice (SNAP, -$0.30, +3 HEI)
   - Chips → Whole grain crackers (SNAP, -$0.20, +4 HEI)
5. **Learns**: User accepts 3/4 → Reward +1.5 → Strengthen SNAP policy

**Result**: User saves $1.00, improves nutrition by +17 HEI points, agent learns effective strategy
